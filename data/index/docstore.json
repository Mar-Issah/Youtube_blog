At about\n30.3 million km2 (11.7 million square miles) including adjacent islands, it covers 20% of\nEarth's land area and 6% of its total surface area.[7] With 1.4 billion people[1][2] as of 2021 , it\naccounts for about 18% of the world's human popul ation. Africa's popul ation is the younge st\namongs t all the continents;[8][9] the median age in 2012 was 19.7, when the worldwide\nmedian age was 30.4.[10] Despite a wide range of natural resources, Africa is the least wealthy\ncontinent per capita and second-least wealthy by total wealth, ahead of Oceania. Scholars\nhave attributed this to different factors including geography, climate,[11] corruption,[11]\ncolonialism, the Cold War,[12][13] and neocolonialism. Despite this low concentration of\nwealth, recent economic expansion and the large and young popul ation make Africa an\nimportant econom ic market in the broader global context.\nThe continent is surrounde d by the Mediterranean Sea to the north, the Isthmus of Suez and\nthe Red Sea to the northeast, the Indian Ocean to the southeast and the Atlantic Ocean to the\nwest. The continent includes Madagascar and various archipelagos. It contains 54 fully\nrecognised sovereign states, eight cities and islands that are part of non-African states, and two\nde facto independent states with limited or no recognition. This count does not include Malta\nand Sicily, which are geologically part of the African continent. Algeria is Africa's largest\ncountry by area, and Nigeria is its largest by popu lation. African nations coope rate through the\nestablishment of the African Union, which is headqua rtered in Addis Ababa.\nAfrica straddles the equator and the prime meridian. It is the only continent to stretch from the\nnorthern temperate to the southern temperate zones.[14] The majority of the continent and its\ncountries are in the Northern Hemisphere, with a substantial portion and a number of\ncountries in the Southern Hemisphere. Most of the continent lies in the tropics, except for a\nlarge part of Western Sahara, Algeria, Libya and Egypt, the northern tip of Mauritania, and the\nentire territories of Morocco, Ceuta, Melilla, and Tunisia which in turn are located above  the\ntropic of Cancer, in the northern temperate zone.

The name had usually been\nconne cted with the Phoenician word \u02bfafar meaning \"dust\",[33] but a 1981 hypot hesis[34] has\nasserted that it stems from the Berber word ifri (plural ifran) meaning \"cave\", in reference to\ncave dwellers.[35] The same word[35] may be found in the name of the Banu Ifran from\nAlgeria and Tripolitania, a Berber tribe originally from Yafran (also know n as Ifrane) in\nnorthwestern Libya,[36] as well as the city of Ifrane in Morocco.\nUnder Roman rule, Carthage became the capital of the province then named Africa\nProconsularis, following its defeat of the Carthaginians in the Third Punic War in 146 BC,\nwhich also included the coastal part of modern Libya.[37] The Latin suffix -ica can sometimes\nbe used to denote a land (e.g., in Celtica from Celtae, as used by Julius Caesar). The later\nMuslim region of Ifriqiya, following its conqu est of the Byzantine (Eastern Roman) Empire's\nExarchatus Africae, also preserved a form of the name.\nAccording to the Romans, Africa lies to the west of Egypt, while \"Asia\" was used to refer to Anatolia\nand lands to the east.

Around 3500 BC,\ndue to a tilt in the Earth's orbit, the Sahara experienced a period of rapid desertification.[59] The popul ation trekked\nout of the Sahara region towards the Nile Valley below the Second Cataract where they made permanent or semi-\npermanent settlements. A major climatic recession occurred, lessening the heavy and persistent rains in Central and\nEastern Africa. Since this time, dry conditions have prevailed in Eastern Africa and, increasingly during the last 200\nyears, in Ethiopia.\nThe domestication of cattle in Africa preceded agriculture and seems to have existed alongside hunter-gatherer cultures. It is speculated that by\n6000 BC, cattle were domesticated in North Africa.[60] In the Sahara-Nile complex, people domesticated many animals, including the donke y\nand a small screw-horned goat which was common from Algeria to Nubia. Between 10,000 and 9,000 BC, pottery was independently invented\nin the region of  Mali in the savannah of West Africa.[61][62] In the steppes and savannahs of the Sahara and Sahel in Northern\nWest Africa, people possibly ancestral to modern Nilo-Saharan and Mand\u00e9 cultures started to collect wild\nmillet,[63] around 8000 to 6000 BCE.

From 4000 BC, the Tichitt\nculture in modern-day Mauritania and Mali is the oldest know n complexly organised society in West Africa, with a\nfour tiered hierarchical social structure.[102] Other civilisations include the Kintampo culture from 2500 BC in\nmodern-day Ghana,[103] the Nok culture from 1500 BC in modern-day Nigeria,[104] the Daima culture around Lake\nChad from 550 BC, Djenn\u00e9-Djenno from 250 BC in modern-day Mali, and the Serer civilisation in modern-day\nSenegal which built the Senegambian stone circles from the 3rd century BC.

Further east, the northern part of the Swahili coast was home to the\nelusive Azania, most likely a Southern Cushitic polity.[117]\nThe Bantu expansion constituted a major series of migrations of Bantu peoples from central Africa to\neastern and southern Africa and was substantial in the settling of the continent.[118] Commencing in the\n2nd millennium BC, the Bantu began to migrate from Cameroon to central, eastern, and southern Africa,\nlaying the founda tions for future states such as the Kingdom  of Kongo  in the Congo Basin, the Empire of\nKitara in the African Great Lakes, the Luba Empire in the Upemba Depression, the Kilwa Sultanate in\nthe Swahili coast by crowding out Azania, with Rhapta being its last stronghol d by the 1st century\nAD,[119] and forming various city states constituting the decentralised Zanj Empire, and the Kingdom  of\nMapungubw e in the Zambezi valley.

Until\nthe fifteenth century, these small states were on the periphery of the major Sudanic empires of the era, paying tribute\nto Songha i to the west and K anem-Borno to the east.\nSlavery had long been practiced in Africa.[128][129] Between the 15th and the 19th centuries, the Atlantic slave trade\ntook an estimated 7\u201312 million slaves to the New World.[130][131][132] In addition, more than 1 million Europeans\nwere captured by Barbary pirates and sold as slaves in North Africa between the 16th and 19t h centuries.[133]\nIn West Africa, the decline of the Atlantic slave trade in the 1820s  caused dramatic econom ic shifts in local polities.\nThe gradual decline of slave-trading, prompted by a lack of demand for slaves in the New World, increasing anti-\nslavery legislation in Europe and America, and the British Royal Navy's increasing presence off the West African\ncoast, obliged African states to adopt new econom ies. Between 1808 and 1860, the British West Africa\nSquadron seized approximately 1,600 s lave ships and freed 150,000 Africans who w ere aboard.[134]\nAction was also taken against African leaders who refused to agree to British treaties to outlaw the trade,\nfor example against \"the usurping King of Lagos\", deposed in 1851. Anti-slavery treaties were signed\nwith over 50 African rulers.[135] The largest powers of West Africa (the Asante Confederacy, the\nKingdom  of Dahomey, and the Oyo Empire) adopted different ways of adapting to the shift. Asante and\nDahomey concentrated on the development of \"legitimate commerce\" in the form of palm oil, cocoa,\ntimber and gold, forming the bedrock of West Africa's modern export trade. The Oyo Empire, unable to\nadapt, collapsed into civil wars.[136]\nThe Scramble for Africa[b] was the invasion and colonisation of most of Africa by seven Western\nEuropean powers driven by the Second Industrial Revolution during the era of \"New Imperialism\"\n(1833\u20131914) . In 1870, 10% of the continent was formally unde r European control.

The vast majority of African states are republics that\noperate under some form of the presidential system of rule. However, few of them have\nbeen able to sustain democratic gove rnments on a permanent basis \u2013 per the criteria laid\nout by L\u00fchrmann et al. (2018) , only Botswana and Mauritius have been consistently\ndemocratic for the entirety of their post-colonial history. Most African countries have\nexperienced several coups  or periods of military dictatorship. Between 1990 and 2018,\nthough, t he continent as a whole has trended towards more democratic gove rnance.[146]\nUpon independence an overwhelming majority of Africans lived in extreme pove rty. The continent suffered from the lack of infrastructural or\nindustrial development unde r colonial rule, along with political instability. With limited financial resources or access to global markets, relatively\nstable countries such as Kenya still experienced only very slow econom ic development. Only a handful of African countries succeeded in\nobtaining rapid econom ic growth prior to 1990. E xceptions include Libya and Equatorial Guinea, both of which pos sess large oil reserves.\nInstability throughou t the continent after decolonization resulted primarily from marginalization of ethnic groups , and corruption. In pursuit of\npersonal political gain, many leaders deliberately promoted ethnic conflicts, some of which had originated during the colonial period, such as\nfrom the grouping of multiple unrelated ethnic groups into a single colony, the splitting of a distinct ethnic group between multiple colonies, or\nexisting conflicts being exacerbated by colonial rule (for instance, the preferential treatment given to ethnic Hutus over Tutsis in Rwanda during\nGerman and B elgian rule).\nFaced with increasingly frequent and severe violence, military rule was widely accepted by the popul ation of many countries as means to\nmaintain order, and during the 1970s  and 1980s  a majority of African countries were controlled by military dictatorships. Territorial disputes\nbetween nations and rebellions by groups seeking independence were also common in independent African states. The most devastating of these\nwas the Nigerian Civil War, fought between government forces and an Igbo separatist republic, which resulted in a famine that killed 1\u20132 million\npeople. Two civil wars in Sudan, the first lasting from 1955 to 1972 and the second from 1983 to 2005, collectively killed around 3 million. Both\nwere fought  primarily on e thnic and religious lines.\nCold War conflicts between the United States and the Soviet Union also contributed to instability. Both the Soviet Union and the United States\noffered considerable incentives to African political and military leaders who aligned themselves with the superpowers' foreign policy. As an\nexample, during the Angolan Civil War, the Soviet and Cuban aligned MPLA and the American aligned UNITA received the vast majority of\ntheir military and political suppor t from these countries. Many African countries became highly dependent on foreign aid. The sudde n loss of\nboth Soviet and American aid at the end of the Cold War and fall of the USSR resulted in severe econom ic and political turmoil in the countries\nmost dependent on foreign suppor t.\nThere was a major famine in Ethiopia between 1983 and 1985, killing up to 1.2 million people, which most historians attribute primarily to the\nforced relocation of farmworkers and seizure of grain by communist Derg government, further exacerbated by the civil war.[147][148][149][150] In\n1994 a genocide in Rwanda resulted in up to 800,000 deaths, added to a severe refugee crisis and fueled the rise of militia groups in neighbor ing\ncountries. This contributed to the outbreak of the first and second Congo Wars, which were the most devastating military conflicts in modern\nAfrica, with up to 5.5 million deaths,[151] making it by far the deadliest conflict in modern African history and one of the costliest wars in human\nhistory.[152]Post-colonial Africa", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4820, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "118b7c1d-a136-4106-8048-d5cabe9bbfdb": {"__data__": {"id_": "118b7c1d-a136-4106-8048-d5cabe9bbfdb", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "9", "file_name": "Africa.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "84095e15-551f-4b71-b719-61a938d42684", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "9", "file_name": "Africa.pdf"}, "hash": "1e4bae12a20391e6f41674d96e9874b783e77bb322411c0b03d45d3023995af8", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "4a62b1b5-e6c2-4b9e-850b-2ef73bce39d2", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "c5e07eb7c5663e3aeb911e03e7d60127f4b4b138ebd97a79b302ccdcd817adfb", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Topography of Africa\nAn animated map\nshows the order of\nindependence of\nAfrican nations, 1950\u2013\n2011 \nAfrica's wars and\nconflicts, 1980\u201396\n  Major\nWars/Conflict\n(>100,000\ncasualties)\n  Minor\nWars/Conflict\n  Other Conflicts \nPolitical map\nof Africa in\n2021\nVarious conflicts between various insurgent groups and gove rnments continue.

The union was officially established\non 9 July 2002[187] as a successor to the Organisation of African Unity (OAU). In July 2004, the African\nUnion's Pan-African Parliament (PAP) was relocated to Midrand, in South Africa, but the African\nCommission on H uman and Peoples' Rights remained in Addis Ababa.\nThe African Union, not to be confused with the AU Commission, is formed by the Constitutive Act of\nthe African Union, which aims to transform the African Econom ic Community, a federated\ncommonwealth, into a state unde r established international conve ntions. The African Union has a\nparliamentary gove rnment, know n as the African Union Government, consisting of legislative, judicial\nand executive organs. It is led by the African Union President and Head of State, who is also the\nPresident of the Pan-African Parliament.

Eighty-one percent of the sub-\nSaharan African population was living on less than $2.50 (PPP) per day in 2005, compared with\n86% for India.[194]\nSub-Saharan Africa is the least successful region of the world in reducing pove rty ($1.25 per day);\nsome 50% of the population living in pove rty in 1981 (200 million people), a figure that rose to\n58% in 1996 before dropping to 50% in 2005 (380 million people). The average poor person in\nsub-Saharan Africa is estimated to live on only 70 cents per day, and was poorer in 2003 than in\n1973,[195] indicating increasing pove rty in some areas. Some of it is attributed to unsuccessful\neconom ic liberalization programmes spearheaded by foreign companies and gove rnments, but\nother studies have cited bad dom estic gove rnment policies more than external factors.[196][197]\nAfrica is now at risk of being in debt once again, particularly in sub-Saharan African countries.\nThe last debt crisis in 2005 was resolved with help from the heavily indebted poor countries\nscheme (HIPC). The HIPC resulted in some positive and negative effects on the econom y in\nAfrica. About ten years after the 2005 debt crisis in sub-Saharan Africa was resolved, Zambia fell\nback into debt. A small reason was due to the fall in coppe r prices in 2011, but the bigger reason\nwas that a large amount of the money Zambia borrowed was wasted or pocketed by t he elite.[198]\nFrom 1995 to 2005, Africa's rate of econom ic growth increased, averaging 5% in 2005.

High Human\nInequality, as measured by the UNDP's Human Development Report's Index of Human Inequality, further impairs the development of human\nsecurity. Tausch also maintains that the certain recent optimism, correspondi ng to econom ic and human rights data, emerging from Africa, is\nreflected in the development of a civil society.\nThe continent is believed to hold 90% of the world's cobalt, 90% of its platinum, 50% of its gold, 98% of its chromium, 70% of its tantalite,[204]\n64% of its manganese and one-third of its uranium.[205] The Democratic Republic of the Congo  (DRC) has 70% of the world's coltan, a mineral\nused in the produc tion of tantalum capacitors for electronic devices such as cell phones. The DRC also has more than 30% of the world's\ndiamond reserves.[206] Guinea is the world's largest exporter of bauxite.[207] As the growth in Africa has been driven mainly by services and not\nmanufacturing or agriculture, it has been growth without jobs and without reduction in pove rty levels.

Large Indian communities are found in South Africa, and smaller\nones are present in Kenya, Tanzania, and some other southern and southeast African countries.\nThe large Indian community in Uganda was expelled by the dictator Idi Amin in 1972, though\nmany have since returned.

Africa is the most multilingua l continent in the world, and it is not rare for\nindividuals to fluently speak not only multiple African langua ges, but one or more European ones as well. There are four major groups\nindigenous to Africa:\nThe Afroasiatic languages are a language family of about 240 languages and 285\nmillion people widespread throughout the Horn of Africa, North Africa, the Sahel, and\nSouthwest Asia.\nThe Nilo-Saharan languages consist of a group of several possibly related\nfamilies,[241] spoken by 30 million people between 100 languages. Nilo-Saharan\nlanguages are spoken by ethnic groups in Chad, Ethiopia, Kenya, Nigeria, Sudan,\nSouth Sudan, Uganda, and northern Tanzania.\nThe Niger-Congo language family covers much of sub-Saharan Africa. In terms of\nnumber of languages, it is the largest language family in Africa and perhaps one of\nthe largest in the world.\nThe Khoisan languages form a group of three unrelated[242] families and two isolates\nand number about fifty in total. They are mainly spoken in Southern Africa by\napproximately 400,000 people.[243] Many of the Khoisan languages are endangered.\nThe Khoi and San peoples are considered the original inhabitants of this part of\nAfrica.\nFollowing the end of colonialism, nearly all African countries adopted official languages that\noriginated outside the continent, although several countries also granted legal recognition to\nindigenous langua ges (such as Swahili, Yoruba, Igbo and Hausa). In numerous countries, English and French (see African French) are used for\ncommunication in the public sphere such as gove rnment, commerce, education and the media. Arabic, Portugue se, Afrikaans and Spanish are\nexamples of langua ges that trace their origin to outside of Africa, and that are used by millions of Africans today, both in the public and private\nspheres. Italian is spoke n by some in former Italian colonies in Africa. German is spoke n in Namibia, as it was a former German protectorate. In\ntotal, at least a fifth of Africans speak the former colonial langua ges.[244][245][246][d]\nMore than 85% of individuals in Africa use traditional medicine as an alternative to often expensive\nallopathic medical health care and costly pharmaceutical produc ts. The Organization of African Unity\n(OAU) Heads of State and Government declared the 2000s  decade as the African Decade on African\ntraditional medicine in an effort to promote The WHO African Region's adopted resolution for\ninstitutionalizing traditional medicine in health care systems across the continent.[247] Public policy\nmakers in the region are challenged with consideration of the importance of traditional/indigenous\nhealth systems and whether their coexistence with the modern medical and health sub-sector would\nimprove the equitability and accessibility of health care distribution, the health status of popul ations,\nand the social-econom ic development of nations within sub-Saharan Africa.[248]\nAIDS in post-colonial Africa is a prevalent issue.

The definition may also include the art of the African\ndiasporas, such as: African-American, Caribbean or art in South American societies inspired by African traditions.\nDespite this diversity, there are unifying artistic themes present when considering the totality of the visual culture\nfrom the continent of Africa.[261]\nPottery, metalwork, sculpture, architecture, textile art and fiber art are important visual art forms across Africa and\nmay be included in the study of African art. The term \"African art\" does not usually include the art of the North\nAfrican areas along the Mediterranean coast, as such areas had long been part of different traditions. For more than a\nmillennium, the art of such areas had formed part of Berber or Islamic art, although  with many particular local\ncharacteristics.\nThe Art of Ethiopia, with a long Christian tradition,[262] is also different from that of most of Africa, where the\nTraditional African religion (with Islam in the north) was dominant until the 20th century.[263] African art includes\nprehistoric and ancient art, the Islamic art of West Africa, the Christian art of East Africa, and the traditional artifacts\nof these and other regions. Many African sculptures were historically made of wood and other natural materials that\nhave not survived from earlier than a few centuries ago, although rare older pottery and metal figures can be found in some areas.[264] Some of\nthe earliest decorative objects, such as shell beads and evidence of paint, have been discovered in Africa, dating to the Middle Stone\nAge.[265][266][267] Masks are important elements in the art of many peoples, along with human figures, and are often highly Stylized. There is a\nvast variety of styles, often varying within the same context of origin and depending on the use of the object, but wide regional trends are\napparent; sculpture is most common among \"groups of settled cultivators in the areas drained by the Niger and Congo  rivers\" in West Africa.[268]\nDirect images of deities are relatively infrequent, but masks in particular are or were often made for ritual ceremonies.

A common theme in traditional African architecture is the use of fractal scaling: small parts of the structure tend to\nlook s imilar to larger parts, such as a circular village made of circular hous es.[272]Visual art\nArchitecture", "start_char_idx": 3672, "end_char_idx": 5783, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "7396c415-656e-47ea-b708-e23a63292561": {"__data__": {"id_": "7396c415-656e-47ea-b708-e23a63292561", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "17", "file_name": "Africa.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "4859a550-4f72-4806-a130-516153b6a9f9", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "17", "file_name": "Africa.pdf"}, "hash": "8a7c85a57aa69837b21c327a23b036dfa8f27d585f6879095cd0962ce3ad0659", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "05fb02b7-e9d6-47f1-9530-777e0d7d39ad", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "3350fdff6d85e109b43d2d725123a697eca7e642e33267bc231044eb2f755629", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "The Great Pyramids of Giza are regarded\nas one of the greatest architectural feats\nof all time and are one of the Seven\nWonders of the Ancient World\nCinematic street poster in Tunis, Tunisia for the\nEgyptian film Saladin the Victorious (1963,\nArabic: \u0627\ufedf\ufeaa\ufef3\ufee6  \ufebb\ufefc\u062d  \u0627\ufedf\ufee8\ufe8e\ufebb\ufeae Al Nasser Salah Ad-\nDin) directed by Youssef Chahine starring Ahmed\nMazhar as Saladin, Salah Zulfikar, Nadia Lutfi\nand others.African architecture in some areas has been influenced by external cultures for centuries, according\nto available evidence. Western architecture has influenced coastal areas since the late 15th century\nand is now  an important source of inspiration for many larger buildings, particularly in major cities.\nAfrican architecture uses a wide range of materials, including thatch, stick/wood, m ud, mudbrick,\nrammed earth, and stone. These material preferences vary by r egion: North Africa for stone and\nrammed earth, the Horn of Africa for stone and m ortar, West Africa for mud/adobe , Central Africa\nfor thatch/wood a nd m ore perishable materials, Southeast and Southern Africa for stone and\nthatch/wood.\nCinema of Africa covers both the history and present of the making or screening of films on the\nAfrican continent, and also refers to the persons involved in this form of audiovisual culture. It dates\nback to the early 20th century, when film reels were the primary cinematic technology in use.\nDuring the colonial era, African life was shown only by the work of white, colonial, Western\nfilmmakers, who depicted Africans in a negative fashion, as exotic \"others\".[273] As there are\nmore than 50 countries with audiovisual traditions, there is no one single 'African cinema'.\nBoth historically and culturally, there are major regional differences between North African\nand sub-Saharan cinemas, and be tween the cinemas of different countries.[273]\nThe Cinema of Egypt and the Cinema of Tunisia are among t he oldest in the world. Cinema\nof Egypt in particular is the most established and flourishing industry in Africa.[274][275]\nPioneers Auguste and Louis Lumi\u00e8re screened their films in Alexandria, Cairo, Tunis, Susa,\nLibya and Hammam-Lif, Tunisia in 1896.[276][277] Albert Samama Chikly is often cited as\nthe first produc er of indigenous African cinema, screening hi s own short documentaries in the\ncasino of Tunis as early as December 1905.[278] Alongside his daughter Hayd\u00e9e Tamzali,\nChikly would go on t o produc e important early milestones such as 1924' s The Girl from\nCarthage . In 1927, E gypt produc ed Laila the first feature-length film by Aziza Amir. In 1935,\nthe Studio Misr in Cairo began produc ing m ostly formulaic comedies and m usicals, but also\nfilms like Kamal Selim's The Will (1939) . Egyptian cinema flourished in the 1940s , 1950s ,\nand 1960s , considered its Golden Age.[279] Youssef Chahine's seminal Cairo Station (1958)\nlaid the founda tion for Arab film.[280]\nGiven the vastness of the African continent, its music is diverse, with regions and nations\nhaving many distinct musical traditions. African music includes the genres amapiano, j\u00f9j\u00fa, fuji, afrobeat, highlife, Congol ese rumba, soukous ,\nndom bolo, makossa, kizomba, Taarab, and others.[281] African music also uses a large variety of instruments from all across the continent. The\nmusic and dance of the African diaspora, formed to varying degrees on African musical traditions, include American music like Dixieland jazz,\nblues, jazz, and many Caribbean genres, such as calypso (see kaiso) and soca. Latin American music genres such as cumbia, salsa music, son\ncubano, rumba, conga , bomba, samba and zouk were founde d on the music of enslaved Africans, and have in turn influenced African popul ar\nmusic.[281][282]\nLike the music of Asia, India and the Middle East, it is a highly rhythmic music.

Songs and da nces facilitate teaching and pr omoting social values, celebrating special events and m ajor life\nmilestones, performing oral history and ot her recitations, and spiritual experiences.[289] African dance uses the concepts of polyrhythm and total\nbody a rticulation.[290] African dances are a collective activity performed in large groups, with significant interaction be tween dancers and\nonlooke rs in the majority of styles.[291]\nFifty-four African countries have football teams in the Confederation of African Football.
